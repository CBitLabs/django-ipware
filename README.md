    from ipware.ip import get_real_ip
    ip = get_real_ip(request)
    if ip is not None:
       # we have a real ip address for user
    else:
       # we don't have a real ip address for user

    # if you want the best matched IP address
    from ipware.ip import get_ip
    ip = get_ip(request)
    if ip is not None:
       # we have an ip address for user
    else:
       # we don't have an ip address for user

Advanced users:
=================
    # you provide your own meta precedence order by
    # including IPWARE_META_PRECEDENCE_ORDER in your
    # settings.py. The check is done from top to bottom
    IPWARE_META_PRECEDENCE_LIST = (
        'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', # client, proxy1, proxy2
        'HTTP_CLIENT_IP',
        'HTTP_X_REAL_IP',
        'HTTP_X_FORWARDED',
        'HTTP_X_CLUSTER_CLIENT_IP',
        'HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR',
        'HTTP_FORWARDED',
        'HTTP_VIA',
        'REMOTE_ADDR',
    )

    # you can provide your own private IP prefixes by
    # including IPWARE_PRIVATE_IP_PREFIX in your setting.py
    # IPs that start with items listed below are ignored
    # and are not considered a `real` IP address
    IPWARE_PRIVATE_IP_PREFIX = (
        '0.', '1.', '2.', # externally non-routable
        '10.', # class A private block
        '169.254.', # link-local block
        '172.16.', '172.17.', '172.18.', '172.19.',
        '172.20.', '172.21.', '172.22.', '172.23.',
        '172.24.', '172.25.', '172.26.', '172.27.',
        '172.28.', '172.29.', '172.30.', '172.31.', # class B private blocks
        '192.0.2.', # reserved for documentation and example code
        '192.168.', # class C private block
        '255.255.255.', # IPv4 broadcast address
    ) + (  # the following addresses MUST be in lowercase)
        '2001:db8:', # reserved for documentation and example code
        'fc00:', # IPv6 private block
        'fe80:', # link-local unicast
        'ff00:', # IPv6 multicast
    )
)
